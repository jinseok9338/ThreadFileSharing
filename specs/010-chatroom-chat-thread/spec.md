**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "대용량 처리 및 나머지 chatroom, chat, thread , 등의 코어 비지니스 로직을 마무리 해야해 그 관련 스펙을 해줘"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature focuses on completing core business logic for chatroom, chat, thread functionality and large file handling
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: chatroom management, chat messaging, thread organization, large file processing
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Define user flows for chatroom creation, messaging, thread management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable and focused on business logic
6. Identify Key Entities (data models for chatroom, chat, thread)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Ensure all requirements are clear and implementable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a team member, I want to create and manage chatrooms, send messages, and organize discussions in threads so that I can collaborate effectively with my team and share files seamlessly.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am a company member, **When** I create a new chatroom, **Then** I can invite other members and start conversations
2. **Given** I am in a chatroom, **When** I send a message, **Then** it appears in real-time for all members
3. **Given** I want to organize a discussion, **When** I create a thread within a chatroom, **Then** I can have focused conversations separate from the main chat
4. **Given** I upload a large file (>4GB), **When** the system processes it, **Then** I receive progress updates and the file is accessible to authorized members
5. **Given** I am viewing a chatroom, **When** files are uploaded, **Then** I can see file previews and download them securely

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a chatroom reaches maximum member limit?
- How does the system handle large file uploads when storage quota is near limit?
- What occurs when a thread becomes too long (>1000 messages)?
- How does the system handle concurrent file uploads from multiple users?
