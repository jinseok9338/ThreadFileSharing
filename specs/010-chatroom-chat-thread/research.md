# Research: 대용량 처리 및 코어 비지니스 로직 완성

## Large File Processing (>4GB)

### Decision: Chunked Upload with Resumable Capability

**Rationale**: Node.js Buffer limitation of 4GB requires streaming approach. Chunked uploads provide better user experience with progress tracking and resume capability.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Direct streaming: Limited by memory constraints and no resume capability
- Client-side chunking: More complex but better performance and reliability
- Server-side assembly: Simpler implementation but less efficient for large files

**Implementation approach**:

- Client splits files into configurable chunks (e.g., 10MB chunks)
- Server validates and stores chunks with metadata
- Assembly process combines chunks on completion
- Resume capability using chunk validation and gap detection

### Decision: MinIO/S3 Streaming Integration

**Rationale**: Existing MinIO/S3 infrastructure supports streaming uploads natively. Leverage existing storage services for consistency.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Direct file system storage: Not suitable for large files and scaling
- Database BLOB storage: Performance issues with large files
- External CDN: Additional complexity and cost

**Implementation approach**:

- Use MinIO/S3 multipart upload for chunked files
- Progress tracking via WebSocket events
- Metadata storage in PostgreSQL for chunk management

## Real-Time Communication Architecture

### Decision: Socket.io with Room-Based Broadcasting

**Rationale**: Existing WebSocket infrastructure provides foundation. Room-based approach scales well for multi-tenant chatrooms.

**Alternatives considered**:

- WebSocket native: More complex connection management
- Server-Sent Events: Limited to server-to-client communication
- Polling: Poor performance and user experience

**Implementation approach**:

- Hierarchical room structure: Company → Chatroom → Thread
- Event-driven architecture for message broadcasting
- Connection state management with automatic reconnection
- Typing indicators and presence status

## Database Design for High-Performance Messaging

### Decision: Optimized Message Storage with Pagination

**Rationale**: Chat applications require fast message retrieval and efficient storage for high-volume messaging.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Single table for all messages: Performance issues with large datasets
- Separate tables per chatroom: Complex queries and maintenance
- NoSQL approach: Lacks ACID properties needed for business logic

**Implementation approach**:

- Partitioned message storage by chatroom/thread
- Optimized indexes for time-based queries
- Cursor-based pagination for large message lists
- Message archiving strategy for long-term storage

### Decision: Thread-Message Association with Cascading Operations

**Rationale**: Threads provide organized discussion structure while maintaining referential integrity.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Flat message structure: Poor organization for complex discussions
- Nested thread structure: Complex queries and UI rendering
- Separate thread metadata: Additional complexity in queries

**Implementation approach**:

- One-to-many relationship: Thread → Messages
- Cascading delete for thread cleanup
- Thread activity tracking and member management
- Thread archiving with message preservation

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Decision: Redis Caching for Active Chatrooms

**Rationale**: Frequently accessed chatroom data benefits from caching to reduce database load.

**Alternatives considered**:

- In-memory caching: Limited by server memory and scaling
- Database query optimization: Limited improvement for real-time access
- CDN caching: Not suitable for dynamic chat data

**Implementation approach**:

- Cache active chatroom metadata and member lists
- Cache recent messages for quick access
- TTL-based cache invalidation
- Cache warming for popular chatrooms

### Decision: WebSocket Connection Pooling

**Rationale**: Efficient connection management reduces server resource usage and improves scalability.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Single connection per user: Resource inefficient
- Connection per chatroom: Complex state management
- Stateless connections: Limited real-time features

**Implementation approach**:

- Single persistent connection per user
- Dynamic room joining/leaving
- Connection health monitoring
- Graceful connection cleanup

## Security and Access Control

### Decision: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Thread-Level Permissions

**Rationale**: Granular permissions needed for different user roles and thread access levels.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Simple owner/member roles: Insufficient for complex collaboration
- Attribute-based access control: Over-engineered for current needs
- Public/private binary: Too restrictive for business use cases

**Implementation approach**:

- Company-level roles: Owner, Admin, Member
- Chatroom-level roles: Creator, Moderator, Member
- Thread-level permissions: Read, Write, Admin
- File access control based on thread membership

## File Upload Security and Validation

### Decision: Multi-Layer File Validation with Virus Scanning

**Rationale**: File uploads present security risks requiring comprehensive validation and scanning.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Basic file type validation: Insufficient security
- Client-side validation only: Easily bypassed
- External scanning service: Additional cost and complexity

**Implementation approach**:

- File type validation (extension + MIME type)
- File size limits with chunked upload support
- Content-based validation for common file types
- Quarantine system for suspicious files
- Signed URLs for secure file access

## Scalability Considerations

### Decision: Horizontal Scaling with Load Balancing

**Rationale**: Chat applications require high availability and horizontal scaling for growth.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Vertical scaling: Limited by hardware constraints
- Single server deployment: Single point of failure
- Microservices architecture: Over-engineered for current scale

**Implementation approach**:

- Stateless application servers
- Database connection pooling
- Redis clustering for session management
- Load balancer with sticky sessions for WebSocket
- Database read replicas for query distribution

## Monitoring and Observability

### Decision: Comprehensive Logging with Real-Time Metrics

**Rationale**: Chat applications require monitoring for performance, security, and user experience.

**Alternatives considered**:

- Basic application logging: Insufficient for production monitoring
- External monitoring services: Additional cost and complexity
- Manual monitoring: Not scalable or reliable

**Implementation approach**:

- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Real-time metrics for message delivery and file uploads
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring for WebSocket connections
- User activity analytics for business insights
