# Tasks: Backend Project Setup with Database

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-backend-db-postgres/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All 28 tasks successfully implemented

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ Found: NestJS + Fastify + TypeORM + PostgreSQL + Docker + Bruno
2. Load optional design documents:
   → ✅ data-model.md: Migration Entity, Configuration Entity, Health Check table
   → ✅ contracts/: health-api.json with 4 endpoints
   → ✅ research.md: Technical decisions and dependencies
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → ✅ Setup: Docker Compose, NestJS project, environment files
   → ✅ Tests: Bruno API tests, Jest unit tests
   → ✅ Core: Health check endpoints, database connection
   → ✅ Integration: TypeORM, migrations, environment configs
   → ✅ Polish: Documentation, validation, cleanup
4. Apply task rules:
   → ✅ Different files = marked [P] for parallel
   → ✅ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → ✅ Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T028)
6. Generate dependency graph and parallel execution examples
7. Validate task completeness: All endpoints, entities, and configs covered
8. Return: ✅ SUCCESS (28 tasks completed successfully)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Backend project**: `packages/backend/` (NestJS application)
- **Bruno tests**: `tests/bruno/` at repository root
- **Environment files**: Repository root (.env.local, .env.development, etc.)
- **Docker files**: Repository root (docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile)

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ✅ COMPLETED

**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

- [x] T009 [P] Bruno API test GET /health in tests/bruno/health/basic-health.bru
- [x] T010 [P] Bruno API test GET /health/database in tests/bruno/health/database-health.bru
- [x] T011 [P] Bruno API test GET /health/ready in tests/bruno/health/readiness.bru
- [x] T012 [P] Bruno API test GET /health/live in tests/bruno/health/liveness.bru
- [x] T013 [P] Backend unit tests for HealthController in packages/backend/src/health/health.controller.spec.ts
- [x] T014 [P] Backend unit tests for DatabaseService in packages/backend/src/database/database.service.spec.ts

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] T015 Configure TypeORM connection in packages/backend/src/database/database.module.ts
- [x] T016 ~~Create health check entity~~ **REMOVED** - Health check table not needed
- [x] T017 Implement HealthController with all endpoints in packages/backend/src/health/health.controller.ts
- [x] T018 Create database service for connection management in packages/backend/src/database/database.service.ts

## Phase 3.4: Integration & Configuration ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] T019 ~~Configure TypeORM migrations~~ **REMOVED** - Migrations not needed for simple setup
- [x] T020 ~~Create initial migration for health_check table~~ **REMOVED** - Health check table removed
- [x] T021 Setup environment-based configuration in packages/backend/src/config/
- [x] T022 Configure Docker Compose health checks and volume persistence
- [x] T023 Setup application bootstrap with environment validation in packages/backend/src/main.ts

## Phase 3.5: Validation & Polish ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] T024 [P] Run Bruno test suite against all environments (local, development, staging)
- [x] T025 [P] Execute quickstart validation scenarios from quickstart.md
- [x] T026 [P] Performance testing for database connection pooling
- [x] T027 [P] Update API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI integration
- [x] T028 [P] Create deployment documentation for Docker Compose setup

## Additional Tasks Completed ✅

- [x] T029 [P] API prefix 변경 (api/v1) 및 Swagger 문서 경로 변경 (/docs)
- [x] T030 [P] Health check 테이블 및 마이그레이션 로직 완전 제거
- [x] T031 [P] Swagger 문서에 response schema 추가 및 DTO 클래스 정의
- [x] T032 [P] DatabaseService 테스트 파일을 HealthCheck 엔티티 제거에 맞게 수정
