# Tasks: WebSocket and API Integration Scenario Testing

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/015-websocket-api-tests/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- Leverage existing test infrastructure (Bruno, WebSocket tests, scenario tests)
- Focus on integration testing rather than creating new test frameworks
- Ensure 100% coverage of existing API and WebSocket scenarios
- Maintain performance benchmarks (API < 500ms, WebSocket < 100ms, 100+ concurrent users)

## Task Generation Rules

_Applied during main() execution_

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
3. **From User Stories**:

   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked by main() before returning_

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities have model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Leverages existing test infrastructure
- [x] Focuses on integration testing
- [x] Maintains performance benchmarks
- [x] Ensures 100% test coverage
