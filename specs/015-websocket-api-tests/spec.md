# Feature Specification: WebSocket and API Integration Scenario Testing

**Feature Branch**: `015-websocket-api-tests`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "이제 websocket, api 종합 시나리오 테스트를 할거야. @tests/ 안을 참조해서 모든 상황별 테스트를 만들고 테스트 해줘. 이게 백엔드 마지막 테스트야"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: What are the specific performance thresholds that should be maintained during concurrent load testing? → A: API response time < 500ms, WebSocket event delivery < 100ms, 100+ concurrent users
- Q: What level of test coverage should be achieved for this final comprehensive testing phase? → A: 100% coverage of all existing API and WebSocket scenarios
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable time for connection recovery and state synchronization after network interruptions? → A: Moderate recovery (< 30 seconds)
- Q: How should test data be managed during the comprehensive integration testing? → A: Mix of existing fixtures and dynamic data generation
- Q: What should be the primary approach for executing the comprehensive integration tests? → A: Sequential execution of all test scenarios with detailed reporting

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a system administrator, I need comprehensive integration testing that validates both WebSocket real-time communication and REST API functionality work together seamlessly, so that I can ensure the entire backend system is production-ready with 100% test coverage across all existing API and WebSocket scenarios.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is authenticated via API, **When** they connect via WebSocket, **Then** they should receive real-time updates for all their authorized resources
2. **Given** a user performs actions via REST API, **When** other users are connected via WebSocket, **Then** they should receive real-time notifications of those actions
3. **Given** multiple users are collaborating, **When** they perform concurrent operations, **Then** all changes should be synchronized in real-time across all connected clients
4. **Given** the system is under load, **When** users perform operations, **Then** both API and WebSocket should maintain performance within acceptable thresholds
5. **Given** network issues occur, **When** connections are interrupted, **Then** the system should gracefully handle reconnection and state synchronization

### Edge Cases

- What happens when WebSocket connection fails but API calls succeed?
- How does system handle concurrent file uploads with real-time progress updates?
- What occurs when a user's permissions change while they have active WebSocket connections?
- How does system manage memory and performance during high-frequency real-time events?
- What happens when database operations fail during WebSocket event broadcasting?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST validate that API authentication tokens work seamlessly with WebSocket connections
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure real-time WebSocket events are triggered by corresponding REST API operations
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain data consistency between API responses and WebSocket event payloads
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle concurrent operations from multiple users without data corruption
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time progress updates for long-running operations (file uploads, processing)
- **FR-006**: System MUST synchronize user status changes across all connected clients in real-time
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that permission changes are immediately reflected in WebSocket event access
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle connection recovery and state synchronization after network interruptions within 30 seconds
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain performance benchmarks for both API and WebSocket under concurrent load (API < 500ms, WebSocket < 100ms, 100+ concurrent users)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide comprehensive error handling and logging for integration failures
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate that file upload progress is accurately broadcast via WebSocket during API upload operations
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure message delivery consistency between API message creation and WebSocket broadcasting
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate that thread and chatroom operations trigger appropriate real-time notifications
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle user role changes and immediately update WebSocket room access permissions
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide real-time storage quota updates when files are uploaded or deleted via API

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **TestUser**: Represents authenticated users with different roles (Owner, Admin, Member, Guest) for comprehensive permission testing, using mix of existing fixtures and dynamic generation
- **TestScenario**: Defines specific integration test cases covering API-WebSocket interaction patterns, executed sequentially with detailed reporting
- **TestResult**: Captures test execution outcomes, performance metrics, and validation results
- **IntegrationEvent**: Represents real-time events that should be synchronized between API operations and WebSocket broadcasting
- **PerformanceMetric**: Tracks response times, throughput, and resource usage for both API and WebSocket operations
