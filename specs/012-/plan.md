# Implementation Plan: API Scenario Test Improvements and Fixes

**Branch**: `012-` | **Date**: 2025-01-05 | **Spec**: `/specs/012-/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/012-/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → Found: /specs/012-/spec.md
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Project Type: web (frontend+backend with existing test infrastructure)
   → Structure Decision: Workspace application with existing test structure
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → No violations exist - test improvements align with TDD principles
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → No NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain - requirements are clear
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → No new violations introduced
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Improve existing API scenario tests to accurately reflect current backend implementation by identifying and fixing tests that incorrectly expect unimplemented features to return errors, updating test expectations for newly available features, and adding proper validation for implemented functionality.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/Node.js (existing test infrastructure)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Bruno API testing, Jest, existing test helpers  
**Storage**: N/A (test improvements only)  
**Testing**: Bruno for API tests, Jest for unit tests, existing test framework  
**Target Platform**: Local development and CI/CD environments  
**Project Type**: web (frontend+backend with existing test infrastructure)  
**Performance Goals**: Maintain existing test execution performance  
**Constraints**: Must not break existing passing tests, preserve test coverage  
**Scale/Scope**: 10 existing scenario test files, ~35 identified unimplemented features to validate

**Structure Decision**: Workspace application with existing test infrastructure. Focus on improving existing scenario tests in `tests/scenarios/api/` directory without creating new test infrastructure.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - All technical context is clear - existing test infrastructure to be improved
   - No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   Research existing scenario test patterns and expectations
   Research backend API implementation status vs test expectations
   Research best practices for updating API test expectations
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Update existing tests to match backend implementation
   - Rationale: Tests should validate actual functionality, not assumed limitations
   - Alternatives considered: Creating new tests (rejected - user specified existing tests only)

**Output**: research.md with test improvement strategy

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - Test scenarios, API endpoints, expected responses
   - Test data structures and validation rules
   - State transitions for test execution

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - Map each test improvement requirement to specific API endpoints
   - Define expected request/response schemas for corrected tests
   - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - Update existing Bruno test files with corrected expectations
   - Assert proper request/response schemas for implemented features
   - Tests must validate actual backend behavior

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Each improvement requirement → updated test scenario
   - Quickstart test = validation of corrected test expectations

5. **Document business logic** in `docs/business/`:

   - Extract test improvement rules from feature requirements
   - Document test validation flows and constraints
   - Create reference for test implementation teams

6. **Design screen wireframes** in `docs/screens/`:

   - N/A - This feature focuses on test improvements, not UI changes

7. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
   - Add test improvement context and Bruno API testing patterns
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/_, updated Bruno tests, quickstart.md, docs/business/_, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each corrected test expectation → test update task [P]
- Each API endpoint validation → Bruno test update task [P]
- Each scenario test file → comprehensive update task
- Implementation tasks to validate backend functionality

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Test updates before validation
- Dependency order: Individual test fixes before scenario integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent test files)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_No constitution violations - test improvements align with TDD principles_

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
