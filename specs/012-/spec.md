# Feature Specification: API Scenario Test Improvements and Fixes

**Feature Branch**: `012-`  
**Created**: 2025-01-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "이번에는 저번 시나리오 테스트 시에 놓쳤던 부분 수정 및 개선 해야해."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Extract: API scenario test improvements, fixing missed issues
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: existing scenario tests, unimplemented features, backend capabilities
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Focus on improving existing scenario tests based on actual backend implementation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable and based on real backend capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → API endpoints, test scenarios, backend services
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Ensure all improvements are based on actual backend implementation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT needs to be fixed in existing tests and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for testers and developers, not business stakeholders

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something, mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Which specific scenario tests need fixing
   - What specific unimplemented features are now available
   - Which test expectations need to be updated
   - What new test cases should be added

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer/tester, I want to improve the existing API scenario tests to accurately reflect the current backend implementation, so that the tests properly validate what is actually available and identify what still needs to be implemented.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** existing scenario tests that may have incorrect expectations, **When** I run the improved tests, **Then** they should accurately reflect the current backend API capabilities
2. **Given** unimplemented features that are now available in the backend, **When** I update the test expectations, **Then** those tests should pass and validate the new functionality
3. **Given** scenario tests that expect errors for unimplemented features, **When** those features are actually implemented, **Then** the tests should be updated to expect success responses

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a previously unimplemented feature is now available but the test still expects an error?
- How do we handle tests that were written assuming certain APIs don't exist?
- What if the backend implementation differs from what the tests expected?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST update existing scenario tests to reflect actual backend API implementation
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and fix tests that incorrectly expect unimplemented features to return errors
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that implemented features (like file deletion, thread-file relationships, user role management) work as expected in tests
- **FR-004**: System MUST update test expectations for features that are now available (e.g., file upload completion, thread archiving)
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain test coverage for features that are genuinely not implemented yet
- **FR-006**: System MUST improve error handling tests to match actual backend error responses
- **FR-007**: System MUST add new test cases for recently implemented backend features

### Key Entities

- **Scenario Tests**: Existing test files in tests/scenarios/api/ that need updates
- **Backend APIs**: Currently implemented endpoints that may not be properly tested
- **Unimplemented Features**: Features listed in unimplemented-features.md that may now be available
- **Test Expectations**: Current test assertions that may need updating based on real backend behavior
