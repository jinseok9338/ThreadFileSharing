# Research: API Scenario Test Improvements and Fixes

**Feature**: 012- API Scenario Test Improvements  
**Date**: 2025-01-05  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

This research phase analyzed the existing API scenario test infrastructure and identified the specific improvements needed to align test expectations with the current backend implementation.

## Key Findings

### 1. Existing Test Infrastructure Analysis

**Decision**: Leverage existing Bruno API testing framework and Jest test infrastructure  
**Rationale**: The project already has a robust test setup with Bruno for API testing, Jest for unit tests, and comprehensive test helpers  
**Alternatives considered**: Creating new test framework (rejected - unnecessary overhead)

### 2. Backend Implementation Status vs Test Expectations

**Decision**: Update test expectations to match actual backend capabilities  
**Rationale**: Many features listed as "unimplemented" in the report are actually available in the backend  
**Key discrepancies identified**:

- File deletion API (`DELETE /api/v1/files/:fileId`) - Implemented but tests expect errors
- Thread-file relationship APIs - Implemented but not properly tested
- User role management - Implemented but test expectations are outdated
- File upload completion - Implemented but tests expect 404 errors
- Storage quota management - Implemented and working
- Company member management - Implemented but test coverage is incomplete

### 3. Test Improvement Strategy

**Decision**: Systematic update of existing scenario tests rather than creating new ones  
**Rationale**: User explicitly requested improvements to existing tests, not new test creation  
**Implementation approach**:

- Identify specific test cases that incorrectly expect unimplemented features
- Update test assertions to match actual backend behavior
- Add validation for newly discovered implemented features
- Maintain test coverage for genuinely unimplemented features

### 4. API Endpoint Analysis

**Decision**: Focus on 10 main scenario test files and ~35 identified feature discrepancies  
**Rationale**: Comprehensive but manageable scope that addresses the core issues  
**Priority areas**:

- File management system tests
- Thread-file relationship tests
- User role and permission tests
- Storage quota tests
- Company member management tests

### 5. Test Data and Validation Patterns

**Decision**: Use existing test data generation and validation helpers  
**Rationale**: The ApiTestHelper class already provides comprehensive test utilities  
**Patterns to maintain**:

- Consistent test data generation
- Proper authentication handling
- Response validation with expected status codes
- Error handling validation

## Technical Decisions

### Test Framework

- **Bruno API Tests**: Continue using existing Bruno collection for API endpoint validation
- **Jest Unit Tests**: Maintain existing Jest setup for backend unit testing
- **Test Helpers**: Leverage existing ApiTestHelper for consistent test execution

### Update Strategy

- **Incremental Updates**: Update one scenario test file at a time
- **Validation First**: Validate backend implementation before updating test expectations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure updates don't break existing passing tests

### Quality Assurance

- **Test Coverage**: Maintain or improve current test coverage
- **Performance**: Ensure test execution time remains reasonable
- **Reliability**: Improve test reliability by matching actual backend behavior

## Implementation Constraints

### Must Not Break

- Existing passing tests
- Current test execution performance
- Test coverage metrics
- CI/CD pipeline functionality

### Must Improve

- Test accuracy (expectations match reality)
- Test reliability (fewer false failures)
- Test maintainability (easier to understand and update)
- Feature validation (proper testing of implemented features)

## Research Validation

All research findings have been validated against:

- Current backend source code analysis
- Existing test infrastructure review
- Unimplemented features report analysis
- User requirements clarification

## Next Steps

The research phase is complete. The findings will be used in Phase 1 to create:

- Detailed data models for test improvements
- API contracts for corrected test expectations
- Business logic documentation for test validation rules
- Quickstart guide for test improvement execution
