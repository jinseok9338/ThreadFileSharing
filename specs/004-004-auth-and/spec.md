## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Stories

#### Story 1: Company Owner Registration

**As a** first-time user  
**I want to** create an account and company  
**So that** I can start using ThreadFileSharing for my team

**Flow**:

1. User visits registration page
2. User enters company name, email, password, and full name
3. System creates new company and user account
4. User becomes company owner automatically
5. User is logged in and redirected to dashboard

#### Story 2: Team Member Invitation

**As a** company owner or admin  
**I want to** invite team members to my company  
**So that** they can collaborate on threads and files

**Flow**:

1. Owner/Admin enters member's email address and role
2. System sends invitation email with unique token
3. Invitee clicks link and completes registration
4. Invitee is added to company with specified role
5. Invitee can access company threads based on permissions

#### Story 3: Thread Access Control

**As a** thread participant  
**I want** only authorized members to access my thread  
**So that** sensitive conversations remain private

**Flow**:

1. User creates thread by uploading file
2. User becomes thread owner automatically
3. User adds specific team members to thread
4. Only added participants can view and interact with thread
5. Non-participants cannot access thread even within same company

#### Story 4: Cross-Team Collaboration

**As a** company member  
**I want to** create threads with members from different teams  
**So that** cross-functional collaboration is possible

**Flow**:

1. User creates thread
2. User adds members from Team A and Team B
3. User adds individual members not in any team
4. All added participants can access thread regardless of team membership

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user visits the platform, **When** they complete registration with valid company name and credentials, **Then** a new company is created, user becomes owner, and receives authentication tokens

2. **Given** a company owner is logged in, **When** they invite a new member via email, **Then** an invitation is sent with a unique token valid for 7 days

3. **Given** a user receives an invitation, **When** they register using the invitation link, **Then** they are added to the inviting company with the specified role

4. **Given** a user is a thread participant, **When** they access the thread, **Then** they can view messages and upload files

5. **Given** a user is NOT a thread participant, **When** they attempt to access the thread, **Then** they receive access denied error

6. **Given** a company admin, **When** they access any thread in their company, **Then** they have read access for audit purposes

7. **Given** a thread owner, **When** they add a new participant, **Then** the participant immediately gains access to thread history

8. **Given** a thread owner, **When** they remove a participant, **Then** the participant loses access immediately

9. **Given** a user with SSO account (Google/Azure), **When** they log in, **Then** they are authenticated and linked to their company account

10. **Given** a user tries to log in with wrong password 5 times, **When** they attempt 6th login, **Then** account is temporarily locked for 15 minutes

### Edge Cases

- **Multiple Company Membership**: What happens when a user tries to join multiple companies?

  - MVP Decision: One user, one company. Future enhancement for multi-company support.

- **Email Conflicts**: What happens when someone tries to register with an email already used in another company?

  - Email must be globally unique across all companies.

- **SSO Email Mismatch**: What happens when SSO email differs from company email domain?

  - Allow any email domain for SSO. Company association via invitation token.

- **Thread Participant Removal**: What happens to messages when a participant is removed?

  - Messages remain in thread. Removed participant loses access but data persists.

- **Company Deletion**: What happens to users, threads, and files when company is deleted?

  - Soft delete company and cascade to all related data. Hard delete after 30-day grace period.

- **Invitation Expiry**: What happens when invitation token expires?
  - Invitation status changes to 'expired'. Owner can resend new invitation.
