# Implementation Plan: Frontend Setup and Validation

**Branch**: `003-frontend-setup` | **Date**: 2025-09-30 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-frontend-setup/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ Found: Frontend setup and validation specification
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✅ Detect Project Type: Frontend validation project
   → ✅ Set Structure Decision: Validation-focused approach
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ No violations: Validation approach aligns with constitution
   → ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ All technical choices clear from user input
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✅ No new violations: Design maintains constitution compliance
   → ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Establish a comprehensive validation process for React 19 frontend project setup with modern tooling (React Router, TanStack Query, Zod, React Hook Form, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS 4). The user will create the actual React project themselves, while the AI assistant provides step-by-step validation to ensure proper configuration, integration, and best practices compliance.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9+ (strict mode), React 19  
**Primary Dependencies**: React Router, TanStack Query, Zod, React Hook Form, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS 4  
**Storage**: N/A (frontend validation only)  
**Testing**: Validation-focused approach (no test creation)  
**Target Platform**: Web browser (React frontend)  
**Project Type**: Frontend validation project  
**Performance Goals**: Fast development server startup, efficient build times, optimal bundle size  
**Constraints**: Must validate all dependencies are compatible, ensure TypeScript compilation passes, verify development server works  
**Scale/Scope**: Single frontend project validation with comprehensive tooling integration

**Structure Decision**: Frontend validation project with comprehensive tooling integration. The focus is on validating React 19 project setup with modern tooling rather than creating the project itself.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - ✅ All technical choices are clear from user input
   - ✅ React 19, React Router, TanStack Query, Zod, React Hook Form, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS 4 specified
   - ✅ Validation approach defined
   - ✅ No testing creation required

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For React 19 setup:
     Task: "Research React 19 best practices and setup requirements"
   For modern tooling integration:
     Task: "Research integration patterns for React Router, TanStack Query, Zod, React Hook Form"
   For shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS 4:
     Task: "Research shadcn/ui setup with Tailwind CSS 4 configuration"
   For validation approach:
     Task: "Research frontend project validation strategies and best practices"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with React 19 setup best practices and modern tooling integration patterns

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - Frontend project structure
   - Validation criteria and checkpoints
   - Tooling integration requirements
   - Configuration file specifications

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - Validation API endpoints
   - Project structure validation contracts
   - Dependency compatibility contracts
   - Build process validation contracts

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - Validation endpoint tests
   - Project structure validation tests
   - Dependency compatibility tests
   - Build process validation tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Project setup validation scenarios
   - Tooling integration validation scenarios
   - Development workflow validation scenarios

5. **Document business logic** in `docs/business/`:

   - Frontend project setup patterns
   - Validation strategies
   - Development workflow rules

6. **Design screen wireframes** in `docs/screens/`:

   - Development environment setup screens
   - Validation feedback interfaces
   - Project structure monitoring screens

7. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
   - Add React 19 and modern tooling setup patterns
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/_, failing tests, quickstart.md, docs/business/_, docs/screens/\*, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_No violations detected - all requirements align with constitution principles_

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
