# Feature Specification: Frontend Setup and Validation

**Feature Branch**: `003-frontend-setup`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "이제 프론트 를 셋업 할거야. 프론트는 리액트 19 , react router, tanstack query, zod, react hook form shadcn tailwind 4 외 다수를 쓸거야. 프론트 프로젝트는 내가 직접 만들거고 너는 매 단계마다 검증만 해줘. 여기서는 프론트 테스트는 만들지 않을거야. 그리고 추가고 package 폴더의 shared 는 없앴어 필요 없을듯 해서."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → ✅ Found: Frontend setup with React 19, React Router, TanStack Query, Zod, React Hook Form, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS 4
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → ✅ Identify: frontend setup, validation process, user creates project, AI validates
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → ✅ All aspects clear from description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → ✅ Clear user flow: user creates frontend, AI validates each step
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → ✅ Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → ✅ Frontend project structure, validation criteria
7. Run Review Checklist
   → ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   → ✅ No implementation details in spec
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer setting up the ThreadFileSharing frontend, I need to create a React 19 project with modern tooling (React Router, TanStack Query, Zod, React Hook Form, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS 4) and have each step validated by an AI assistant to ensure proper configuration and integration.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer wants to create a React frontend project, **When** they set up the project structure, **Then** the AI should validate that all required dependencies are properly installed and configured
2. **Given** the frontend project is being set up, **When** the developer configures routing with React Router, **Then** the AI should verify that routing is properly configured and working
3. **Given** the frontend needs state management, **When** the developer integrates TanStack Query, **Then** the AI should validate that data fetching and caching are properly configured
4. **Given** the frontend needs form handling, **When** the developer sets up React Hook Form with Zod validation, **Then** the AI should verify that form validation works correctly
5. **Given** the frontend needs UI components, **When** the developer integrates shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS 4, **Then** the AI should validate that the component library is properly configured and styled
6. **Given** the frontend project is complete, **When** the developer runs the development server, **Then** the AI should verify that the application starts without errors and all features work as expected

### Edge Cases

- What happens when dependencies have version conflicts?
- How does the system handle missing or incorrectly configured dependencies?
- What happens when the development server fails to start?
- How does the system handle TypeScript compilation errors?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST validate that React 19 is properly installed and configured
- **FR-002**: System MUST verify that React Router is correctly set up for client-side routing
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that TanStack Query is properly configured for data fetching and caching
- **FR-004**: System MUST verify that Zod is correctly integrated for runtime validation
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that React Hook Form is properly set up for form handling
- **FR-006**: System MUST verify that shadcn/ui components are correctly installed and configured
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that Tailwind CSS 4 is properly configured for styling
- **FR-008**: System MUST verify that the development server starts without errors
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that all TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- **FR-010**: System MUST verify that the project structure follows best practices
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate that all dependencies are compatible with each other
- **FR-012**: System MUST verify that the build process works correctly

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Frontend Project**: React 19 application with modern tooling and best practices
- **Dependencies**: All required packages and their proper configuration
- **Project Structure**: Organized file and folder structure following React best practices
- **Configuration Files**: TypeScript, Tailwind, and other configuration files
- **Development Environment**: Local development setup and tooling

## Additional Context

This feature focuses on setting up and validating a modern React frontend project. The user will create the actual React project themselves, and this specification ensures that the AI assistant provides proper validation and guidance at each step of the setup process.

The validation process will cover:

- Dependency installation and configuration
- Project structure and organization
- Tooling integration and setup
- Development environment validation
- Build process verification

This approach ensures that the frontend project is properly configured with all required modern tooling and follows React best practices.
