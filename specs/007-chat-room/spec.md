# Feature Specification: Chat Room Layout

**Feature Branch**: `007-chat-room`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "메인 레이아웃을 짜고 메인 chat room 이 있는 페이지를 만들어야 할거 같아 이미지는 팀즈의 레이아웃인데 일단 저런 레이아웃인데 왼쪽 메뉴는 현재로서는 채팅, 세팅 (테마) 정도 일거 같아. 위의 검색도 기능은 아직 못넣을거 같아."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a logged-in user, I want to access the main chat interface so that I can participate in conversations and navigate between different sections of the application.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Layout & Navigation:**

1. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they access the main application, **Then** they see a three-column layout with navigation, chat list, and chat room area
2. **Given** the main layout is displayed, **When** user clicks on "채팅" in the left navigation, **Then** they see the chat interface with available conversations
3. **Given** the main layout is displayed, **When** user clicks on "세팅" in the left navigation, **Then** they see theme settings and configuration options
4. **Given** the main layout is displayed, **When** user navigates between sections, **Then** the layout remains consistent and responsive

**Chat Room Management:** 5. **Given** multiple chat rooms exist, **When** user clicks on a different chat room, **Then** the right column updates to show that chat room's messages 6. **Given** no chat rooms exist, **When** user accesses the chat section, **Then** they see an empty state message 7. **Given** many chat rooms exist, **When** user scrolls the chat list, **Then** the list scrolls smoothly with virtual scrolling

**Real-time Messaging:** 8. **Given** a chat room is selected, **When** user types a message and sends it, **Then** the message appears immediately in the chat 9. **Given** another user is typing, **When** user is viewing the chat room, **Then** they see "사용자명이 입력중..." indicator 10. **Given** multiple users are typing simultaneously, **When** user is viewing the chat room, **Then** they see all typing indicators 11. **Given** messages are being sent, **When** user is viewing the chat room, **Then** messages appear in chronological order with timestamps

**File Upload & Thread Creation:** 12. **Given** a chat room is selected, **When** user uploads a file, **Then** a new thread is automatically created 13. **Given** a file is being uploaded, **When** user is viewing the chat room, **Then** they see upload progress indicator 14. **Given** a file upload fails, **When** user attempts to upload, **Then** they see an error message 15. **Given** files are attached to messages, **When** user views messages, **Then** they see file names and appropriate icons

**Settings & Theming:** 16. **Given** user is in settings, **When** they change theme from dark to light, **Then** the interface updates immediately 17. **Given** user has changed theme, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** their theme preference is preserved

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no chat rooms available?
- How does the layout handle different screen sizes (desktop only, no mobile support)?
- What happens when a user has many chat rooms (scrollable list with virtual scrolling)?
- What happens when multiple users are typing simultaneously?
- How does the system handle file upload failures?
- What happens when a thread is created from a file upload?
