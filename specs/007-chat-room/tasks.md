# Tasks: Chat Room Layout

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-chat-room/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   â†’ Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load design documents:
   â†’ data-model.md: Extract entities â†’ model tasks
   â†’ contracts/: Each file â†’ contract test task
   â†’ research.md: Extract decisions â†’ setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   â†’ Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   â†’ Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   â†’ Core: models, services, components
   â†’ Integration: DB, middleware, Socket.io
   â†’ Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   â†’ Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   â†’ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   â†’ Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
```

- T013-T015 (layout components) before T016-T022 (chat components)
- T023-T026 (thread components) can be parallel with chat components
- T027-T030 (UI enhancement components) can be parallel
- T031-T034 (pages/routes) after all components
- Implementation before integration (T035-T042)
- Integration before polish (T043-T056)

## Parallel Execution Examples

```
# Launch shadcn/ui component setup together:
Task: "Add shadcn/ui ResizablePanelGroup component in packages/frontend/app/components/ui/resizable.tsx"
Task: "Add shadcn/ui Sidebar component in packages/frontend/app/components/ui/sidebar.tsx"
Task: "Add shadcn/ui ScrollArea component in packages/frontend/app/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx"

# Launch chat component creation together:
Task: "Chat room list component in packages/frontend/app/components/chat/ChatRoomList.tsx"
Task: "Chat room content component in packages/frontend/app/components/chat/ChatRoomContent.tsx"
Task: "Message list component in packages/frontend/app/components/chat/MessageList.tsx"

# Launch thread component creation together:
Task: "Thread panel component in packages/frontend/app/components/thread/ThreadPanel.tsx"
Task: "Thread list component in packages/frontend/app/components/thread/ThreadList.tsx"
Task: "Thread detail component in packages/frontend/app/components/thread/ThreadDetail.tsx"
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- **Focus on UI implementation first, backend logic later**
- All components must follow shadcn/ui design system
- Use @tanstack/react-virtual for performance optimization
- Mock data for UI development, real API integration later

## Task Generation Rules

_Applied during main() execution_

1. **UI-First Approach**: Components â†’ Integration â†’ Polish
2. **shadcn/ui Components**: All UI components use shadcn/ui design system
3. **@tanstack/react-virtual**: Performance optimization for lists
4. **Mock Data**: Use mock data for UI development
5. **Dependencies**: Block parallel execution when files are shared

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked before returning_

- [x] All UI components have corresponding tests
- [x] All components follow shadcn/ui design system
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] UI-focused implementation with mock data
- [x] Collapsible panels for better space management
- [x] @tanstack/react-virtual for performance optimization

## Current Status Summary

### âœ… **COMPLETED PHASES (T001-T056)**

- **Phase 3.1**: UI Setup - All dependencies and shadcn/ui components added
- **Phase 3.3**: UI Components Implementation - All chat, thread, and layout components implemented
