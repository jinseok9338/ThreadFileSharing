## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a team member, I want to upload files (including large files and multiple files simultaneously) to chatrooms and threads so that I can share documents, images, and other media with my team members. The system should show me the upload progress and handle any errors gracefully.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is in a chatroom, **When** they select a single large file to upload, **Then** the system uploads it to S3/MinIO storage and shows real-time progress
2. **Given** a user wants to share multiple files, **When** they select multiple files simultaneously, **Then** the system uploads each file individually with separate progress tracking
3. **Given** a file upload is in progress, **When** the user checks the status, **Then** they can see percentage complete, upload speed, and estimated time remaining
4. **Given** a file upload fails, **When** the system encounters an error, **Then** it shows a clear error message and allows retry
5. **Given** a file is successfully uploaded, **When** the upload completes, **Then** it's immediately available for download and sharing in the chatroom/thread
6. **Given** a user uploads a file to a thread, **When** the upload completes, **Then** the file is associated with the thread and accessible to all thread participants

### Edge Cases

- What happens when network connection is lost during upload?
- How does the system handle files that exceed storage quotas?
- What happens when a file upload is interrupted and resumed?
- How does the system handle duplicate file uploads (same filename/content)?
- What happens when MinIO/S3 storage is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle very large files (multi-gigabyte)?
- What happens when multiple users upload files simultaneously?
- How does the system handle corrupted or malicious files?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support uploading individual files of any size to S3/MinIO storage
- **FR-002**: System MUST support simultaneous upload of multiple files with independent progress tracking
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide real-time upload progress information (percentage, speed, time remaining)
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate with MinIO for local development and S3-compatible services for production
- **FR-005**: System MUST associate uploaded files with specific chatrooms and/or threads
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle upload failures gracefully with clear error messages and retry options
- **FR-007**: System MUST support file metadata storage (filename, size, type, upload timestamp, uploader)
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce company storage quotas during file uploads
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide secure file download URLs with appropriate access controls
- **FR-010**: System MUST support file deletion and cleanup when no longer needed
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain audit trails for all file upload, download, and deletion activities
- **FR-012**: System MUST support resumable uploads for large files that may be interrupted
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate file types and sizes before allowing uploads
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide file search and filtering capabilities within chatrooms/threads
- **FR-015**: System MUST support file versioning when the same file is uploaded multiple times

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **File**: Digital asset with metadata (name, size, type, hash, upload timestamp, uploader) stored in S3/MinIO with database reference
- **UploadProgress**: Real-time tracking entity showing upload status, percentage complete, speed, and estimated completion time for each file
- **FileAssociation**: Links files to specific chatrooms and/or threads with appropriate access permissions
- **StorageQuota**: Company-level storage limits and usage tracking to enforce business rules
- **UploadSession**: Temporary entity tracking multi-file upload sessions with individual file progress and overall status
- **FileMetadata**: Detailed information about uploaded files including processing status, thumbnail generation, and content analysis
- **DownloadToken**: Secure, time-limited access tokens for file downloads with proper authorization

## Technical Context Integration

### Existing System Integration

Based on the current ThreadFileSharing system architecture:

- **Authentication**: File uploads require valid JWT authentication and company membership
- **Authorization**: File access follows existing company and thread permission structures
- **Storage Integration**: MinIO for local development, S3-compatible services for production
- **Database**: File metadata stored in existing PostgreSQL database with proper relationships
- **Real-time Updates**: Upload progress and completion events broadcast via WebSocket to relevant users

### Storage Strategy

- **Local Development**: MinIO container in Docker Compose for S3-compatible storage
- **Production**: AWS S3 or similar cloud storage service
- **File Organization**: Company-based bucket structure with proper access controls
- **Backup Strategy**: Standard cloud storage redundancy and backup policies

### Performance Considerations

- **Large File Support**: Chunked upload for files over [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific size threshold]
- **Concurrent Uploads**: Support for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum concurrent uploads per user/company]
- **Upload Speed**: Optimize for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target upload speeds or performance requirements]
- **Storage Efficiency**: Deduplication and compression where appropriate
