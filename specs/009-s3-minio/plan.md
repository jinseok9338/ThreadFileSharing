# Implementation Plan: S3/MinIO File Upload System

**Branch**: `009-s3-minio` | **Date**: 2024-12-19 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/009-s3-minio/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → ✅ Found: S3/MinIO file upload system specification
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → ✅ Detect Project Type: Backend-focused file upload system
   → ✅ Set Structure Decision: Backend-only implementation with comprehensive testing
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ No violations: Backend-focused approach aligns with constitution
   → ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ All technical choices clear from user input and existing system
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✅ No new violations: Design maintains constitution compliance
   → ✅ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Implement comprehensive S3/MinIO file upload system for ThreadFileSharing with focus on backend infrastructure, testing, and real-time progress tracking.

**Testing**: Bruno API tests, Jest unit/integration tests, Docker Compose test environment  
**Target Platform**: NestJS backend service with Docker containerization  
**Project Type**: Backend-focused implementation with comprehensive testing  
**Performance Goals**: Support large files (multi-gigabyte), concurrent uploads, real-time progress tracking  
**Constraints**: Backend-only focus, test-driven development, Docker Compose integration  
**Scale/Scope**: Single backend service with file upload capabilities, comprehensive test coverage

docker-compose.yml  # Updated with MinIO service
```

**Structure Decision**: Backend-focused workspace with comprehensive file upload infrastructure. MinIO integration via Docker Compose, extensive testing with Bruno API tests and Jest unit tests, real-time progress tracking via WebSocket.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - ✅ All technical choices are clear from user input and existing system
   - ✅ AWS SDK v3, MinIO client, Multer integration patterns established
   - ✅ Docker Compose integration for MinIO service
   - ✅ Test-driven approach with Bruno and Jest

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For S3/MinIO integration:
     Task: "Research AWS SDK v3 and MinIO client best practices for Node.js"
   For file upload patterns:
     Task: "Research NestJS file upload patterns with Multer and progress tracking"
   For WebSocket integration:
     Task: "Research Socket.io patterns for real-time upload progress broadcasting"
   For testing strategies:
     Task: "Research comprehensive testing strategies for file upload systems"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with S3/MinIO integration patterns, file upload best practices, and testing strategies

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - File entity with S3/MinIO metadata
   - UploadProgress entity for real-time tracking
   - FileAssociation entity for chatroom/thread relationships
   - StorageQuota entity for company limits

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - File upload endpoints (single/multiple)
   - Upload progress tracking endpoints
   - File download and deletion endpoints
   - Storage quota management endpoints
   - WebSocket events for progress updates

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - File upload API tests
   - Progress tracking tests
   - Error handling tests
   - Storage integration tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Single file upload workflow
   - Multiple file upload workflow
   - Progress tracking scenarios
   - Error handling scenarios

5. **Document business logic** in `docs/business/`:

   - File upload business rules
   - Storage quota enforcement
   - File access control policies
   - Upload progress tracking logic

6. **Design quickstart validation** in `quickstart.md`:

   - MinIO setup and configuration
   - File upload testing scenarios
   - Progress tracking validation
   - Error handling verification

7. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
   - Add S3/MinIO integration patterns
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/_, failing tests, quickstart.md, docs/business/_, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Docker Compose MinIO setup → infrastructure task [P]
- File entity and migrations → database setup tasks
- Storage service implementation → S3/MinIO integration tasks
- File upload controller/service → API implementation tasks
- WebSocket gateway → real-time progress tasks
- Bruno API tests → comprehensive testing tasks [P]
- Jest unit tests → backend testing tasks [P]

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Infrastructure first: Docker Compose MinIO, environment configuration
- Database setup: File entities, migrations, relationships
- Storage integration: S3/MinIO services, configuration
- API implementation: Controllers, services, DTOs
- Real-time features: WebSocket gateway, progress tracking
- Testing: Bruno API tests, Jest unit tests, integration tests
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent setup and testing tasks)

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on backend implementation and comprehensive testing

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_No violations detected - backend-focused approach aligns with constitution principles_

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
