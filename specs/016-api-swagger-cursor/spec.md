# Feature Specification: 백엔드 API 문서 개선 및 Swagger 응답 스키마 보완

**Feature Branch**: `016-api-swagger-cursor`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "백엔드 API 문서 개선 및 Swagger 응답 스키마 보완 - cursor pagination 파라미터 통일 및 누락된 응답 문서 추가"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: Cursor Pagination 파라미터 통일 방식 → A: lastIndex
- Q: 응답 스키마 문서화 범위 → A: 모든 컨트롤러의 모든 엔드포인트 완전 문서화
- Q: Cursor Pagination 구현 검증 범위 → A: 모든 pagination 엔드포인트의 구현과 문서 일치성 검증
- Q: 에러 응답 문서화 수준 → A: 주요 에러 케이스만 문서화 (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- Q: 문서화 우선순위 → A: 알파벳 순서 (auth → chatroom → company → file → message → thread)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer integrating with the API, I need comprehensive and accurate API documentation with complete response schemas and consistent parameter naming, so that I can successfully integrate with the backend services without confusion or missing information.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer wants to use cursor-based pagination, **When** they check the API documentation, **Then** they see consistent parameter naming using `lastIndex` (not `cursor`)
2. **Given** a developer calls any API endpoint, **When** they receive a response, **Then** the response schema is fully documented in Swagger with all possible fields and data types
3. **Given** a developer encounters an error, **When** they check the documentation, **Then** all possible error responses are documented with proper status codes and error message formats
4. **Given** a developer wants to understand pagination, **When** they read the documentation, **Then** they can clearly understand how to use cursor-based pagination with examples

### Edge Cases

- What happens when pagination parameters are invalid or malformed?
- How does the system handle missing or incomplete response documentation?
- What occurs when API responses don't match documented schemas?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST use `lastIndex` parameter consistently for cursor-based pagination across all endpoints (remove `cursor` parameter from documentation)
- **FR-002**: System MUST document ALL API response schemas across ALL controllers with complete field definitions and data types
- **FR-003**: System MUST document major error cases (400, 401, 403, 404, 500) with proper status codes and error message formats
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear examples for pagination parameters and responses
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure all API endpoints have complete Swagger documentation following alphabetical order (auth → chatroom → company → file → message → thread)
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that actual API responses match documented schemas AND verify cursor pagination implementation consistency across ALL pagination endpoints
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide consistent error response formats across all endpoints
- **FR-008**: System MUST include proper data type definitions for all response fields
- **FR-009**: System MUST document optional vs required fields in all response schemas
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide working examples for all documented endpoints

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **API Endpoint**: Represents a single API endpoint with its complete documentation including parameters, responses, and examples
- **Response Schema**: Defines the structure and data types of API responses with field descriptions and validation rules
- **Pagination Parameter**: Represents cursor-based pagination parameters with consistent naming and usage patterns
- **Error Response**: Defines standardized error response formats with status codes, error codes, and message structures
