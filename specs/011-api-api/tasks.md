# Tasks: Comprehensive API Testing Suite

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/011-api-api/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Implementation plan loaded successfully
   → Extract: Node.js 20+, TypeScript 5.0+, Bruno API Testing Framework
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: api-contracts.yaml → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: Extract test scenarios → integration tests
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: test infrastructure, Bruno configuration
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, security tests
   → Core: test data models, automation scripts
   → Integration: test environment, CI/CD
   → Polish: documentation, performance, reporting
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All API endpoints have tests?
   → All test scenarios covered?
   → All automation scripts generated?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- Each Bruno test file should cover one specific scenario
- Test data generation should be deterministic and repeatable
- All test scripts should be executable and well-documented

## Task Generation Rules

_Applied during main() execution_

1. **From Contracts**:
   - api-contracts.yaml → comprehensive contract test tasks [P]
   - Each endpoint → success/failure test scenarios [P]
   - Each HTTP method → specific test variations [P]
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → test data generation task [P]
   - Each relationship → test scenario validation
   - Each validation rule → test case generation
3. **From Research**:
   - Bruno framework → Bruno test setup tasks
   - Security testing → security test scenarios [P]
   - Performance testing → performance test scenarios [P]
4. **From Quickstart**:
   - Each test phase → integration test tasks
   - Each test scenario → validation tasks
   - Each test workflow → automation tasks

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked by main() before returning_

- [x] All API endpoints have corresponding Bruno tests
- [x] All test scenarios have data generation tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
