# Feature Specification: Comprehensive API Testing Suite

**Feature Branch**: `011-api-api`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "이제 전체 적인 테스트를 할거야. 이거는 통과 테스트 실패 케이스 다 마찬 가지이고 모든 권한에 대해서 할거야, 최대한 모든 시나리오를 짜주고 그거대로 api 테스트 들을 진행 할거야. 이거는 하나의 api 테스트가 통과하면 그 시나리오 대로 테스트 스크립트 (순서에 맞게) 를 만들어 줘야해 문서를 위해서."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Extract comprehensive API testing requirements
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: success/failure scenarios, permission levels, test automation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Define complete API testing workflow
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable and automated
   → Cover all API endpoints and permission scenarios
6. Identify Key Entities (API endpoints, test data, permissions)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Ensure comprehensive coverage and automation readiness
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

**As a** QA Engineer / Developer  
**I want to** run comprehensive API tests covering all scenarios  
**So that** I can ensure system reliability, security, and functionality across all user roles and edge cases

### Acceptance Scenarios

2. **Given** invalid credentials, **When** user attempts authentication, **Then** system returns 401 Unauthorized
3. **Given** expired token, **When** user makes API request, **Then** system returns 401 with refresh instruction
4. **Given** user without permissions, **When** user accesses protected resource, **Then** system returns 403 Forbidden

#### 6. Message System Testing

1. **Given** chatroom member, **When** sending message, **Then** system delivers message successfully
2. **Given** non-member, **When** attempting to send message, **Then** system returns 403 Forbidden
3. **Given** message with thread references, **When** sending message, **Then** system parses and links references
4. **Given** message sender, **When** editing message, **Then** system updates message successfully

#### 7. File Upload Testing

3. **Given** unsupported file type, **When** uploading, **Then** system returns 400 Bad Request
4. **Given** chunked upload, **When** uploading large file, **Then** system handles chunks correctly

#### 8. Permission Matrix Testing

1. **Given** owner role, **When** accessing any resource, **Then** system grants full access
2. **Given** admin role, **When** accessing user management, **Then** system grants admin access
3. **Given** member role, **When** accessing admin functions, **Then** system returns 403 Forbidden
4. **Given** guest role, **When** accessing protected resources, **Then** system returns 401 Unauthorized

### Edge Cases

- What happens when database connection fails during API request?
- How does system handle malformed JSON in request body?
- What occurs when rate limiting is exceeded?
- How does system handle concurrent requests from same user?
- What happens when file upload is interrupted mid-stream?
- How does system handle invalid UUID format in path parameters?
- What occurs when required fields are missing from request body?
- How does system handle SQL injection attempts in search parameters?
