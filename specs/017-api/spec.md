**Feature Branch**: `017-api`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Ïù¥Ï†ú ÌîÑÎ°†Ìä∏ Ïóê Î∞±ÏóîÎìú api Î•º Ïó∞Í≤∞ Ìï†Í±∞Ïïº."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a frontend developer, I need to connect the existing React frontend components to the backend API endpoints, so that users can interact with real data instead of mock data and experience the full functionality of the thread-based file sharing application.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is on the login page, **When** they enter valid credentials and submit the form, **Then** they should be authenticated and redirected to the main application with their user data loaded from the backend
2. **Given** a user is viewing the chat room list, **When** the component loads, **Then** it should display real chat rooms from the backend API instead of mock data
3. **Given** a user is in a chat room, **When** they send a message, **Then** the message should be saved to the backend and broadcast to other users via WebSocket
4. **Given** a user uploads a file, **When** the upload completes, **Then** the file should be processed by the backend and available for sharing in threads
5. **Given** a user creates a thread from files, **When** the thread is created, **Then** it should be saved to the backend and visible to other participants

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the backend API is unavailable during component initialization?
- How does the system handle authentication token expiration during API calls?
- What occurs when file upload fails due to network issues or server errors?
- How does the application behave when WebSocket connection is lost during active chat?
- What happens when API responses contain unexpected data formats?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Frontend components MUST connect to backend API endpoints to replace all mock data with real data
- **FR-002**: Authentication flow MUST integrate with backend login/register/logout endpoints
- **FR-003**: Chat room components MUST fetch and display real chat rooms from backend API
- **FR-004**: Message components MUST send messages to backend API and receive real-time updates via WebSocket
- **FR-005**: File upload components MUST upload files to backend storage and track upload progress
- **FR-006**: Thread components MUST create, manage, and display threads using backend API
- **FR-007**: User profile components MUST display and update user information from backend API
- **FR-008**: Error handling MUST gracefully manage API failures and network issues
- **FR-009**: Loading states MUST provide user feedback during API operations
- **FR-010**: WebSocket integration MUST maintain real-time communication for chat and notifications

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **API Client**: Represents the connection layer between frontend components and backend endpoints, handling authentication, requests, and responses
- **Component State**: Represents the local state management within React components that syncs with backend data
- **WebSocket Connection**: Represents the real-time communication channel for live updates and notifications
- **Authentication Token**: Represents the security credentials used to authorize API requests and maintain user sessions
- **Error Boundary**: Represents the error handling mechanism that manages API failures and provides user feedback

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

Based on the analysis of the existing frontend structure, the following clarifications are provided:

1. **Existing API Infrastructure**: The frontend already has a well-structured API client using Ky with authentication handling, token refresh logic, and error management.

2. **Component Structure**: The frontend has comprehensive component documentation (`.md` files) that describe the expected behavior and props for each component, making API integration straightforward.

3. **Mock Data Replacement**: Components currently use mock data (as seen in `ChatRoomContent.tsx`) that needs to be replaced with real API calls.

4. **WebSocket Integration**: The frontend has WebSocket hooks (`useSocket.ts`) that need to be connected to the backend WebSocket gateway.

5. **Authentication Flow**: Login/register components already have API service files that connect to backend auth endpoints.

6. **Component-First Approach**: The development approach will be to modify component documentation first, then implement the API connections as specified in the documentation.

The feature is ready for planning phase as the scope is clear: replace mock data with real backend API integration across all frontend components while maintaining the existing UI/UX patterns.
