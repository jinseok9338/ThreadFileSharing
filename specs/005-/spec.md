# Feature Specification: Frontend Authentication & User Profile

**Feature Branch**: `005-frontend-auth-login`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Î°úÍ∑∏Ïù∏ ÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄ Î∂ÄÌÑ∞ ÎßåÎì§Ïûê. AuthLayout Í≥º ÌéòÏù¥ÏßÄÎ•º ÎßåÎì§Ïñ¥Ïïº ÌïòÍ≥†, protected Routes ÏÑ§Ï†ï"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Login page, AuthLayout, Protected Routes
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Unauthenticated users, Authenticated users
   ‚Üí Actions: Login, Register, View profile, Change theme
   ‚Üí Data: User credentials, user profile, theme preference
   ‚Üí Constraints: Protected routes require authentication
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Auth method specified: Email/Password (from backend Day 2)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Theme system already implemented (5 themes available)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Login flow, Protected route access, Profile management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí User, AuthState, ThemePreference
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details in requirements
   ‚Üí All sections completed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

**As a** team member  
**I want to** log into the ThreadFileSharing platform  
**So that** I can access my files, threads, and collaborate with my team securely

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Successful Login

1. **Given** I am an unregistered visitor on the login page
2. **When** I enter valid email and password credentials
3. **Then** the system authenticates me and redirects me to the home page
4. **And** I can access all protected features

#### Scenario 2: Failed Login

1. **Given** I am on the login page
2. **When** I enter invalid credentials (wrong email or password)
3. **Then** the system shows an error message
4. **And** I remain on the login page
5. **And** my password input is cleared for security

#### Scenario 3: New User Registration

1. **Given** I am a new user on the registration page
2. **When** I provide valid registration information (email, password, company name)
3. **Then** the system creates my account and company
4. **And** I am automatically logged in
5. **And** I am redirected to the home page

#### Scenario 4: Protected Route Access

1. **Given** I am not logged in
2. **When** I try to access a protected page URL directly
3. **Then** the system redirects me to the login page
4. **And** after successful login, I am redirected back to the originally requested page

#### Scenario 5: Already Authenticated User

1. **Given** I am already logged in
2. **When** I try to access the login or registration page
3. **Then** the system redirects me to the home page
4. **And** I see a message that I'm already authenticated

#### Scenario 6: Profile Management

1. **Given** I am logged in and on my profile page
2. **When** I view my profile
3. **Then** I can see my user information (name, email, company, role)
4. **And** I can change my theme preference
5. **And** the theme change is applied immediately and persisted

#### Scenario 7: Theme Persistence

1. **Given** I have selected a theme preference
2. **When** I log out and log back in
3. **Then** my previously selected theme is still active

#### Scenario 8: Session Persistence

1. **Given** I am logged in
2. **When** I close my browser and reopen it
3. **Then** I am still logged in (if refresh token is valid)
4. **And** I can continue working without re-authentication

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when** my session expires while I'm using the app?

  - System should detect expired token and redirect to login
  - Original page URL should be preserved for post-login redirect

- **What happens when** I try to register with an email that already exists?

  - System shows clear error message
  - Suggests login instead

- **What happens when** network connection fails during login?

  - System shows connection error message
  - Allows retry without losing entered data

- **What happens when** I navigate back after successful login?
  - System prevents access to login page
  - Keeps me on authenticated area

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

#### Authentication Flow

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a login page accessible at `/auth/login` route
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a registration page accessible at `/auth/register` route
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate user credentials (email and password format) on the client side before submission
- **FR-004**: System MUST display clear error messages for authentication failures (invalid credentials, network errors, validation errors)
- **FR-005**: System MUST store authentication tokens securely in browser localStorage (accessToken and refreshToken)
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically redirect authenticated users away from login/register pages to the home page
- **FR-007**: System MUST support automatic token refresh when access token expires
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a logout functionality that clears all stored tokens and redirects to login page

#### Protected Routes

- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent unauthenticated users from accessing any route except `/auth/login` and `/auth/register`

  - Status: Active/inactive, email verified
  - Timestamps: Created at, last login

- **AuthState**: Represents current authentication status with properties:

  - Authentication: Access token, refresh token, authenticated flag
  - User data: Current user information
  - Loading state: Loading flag for async operations
