# Chatroom Management Business Logic

## Overview

Chatrooms are the primary communication channels within companies. They provide organized spaces for team collaboration, file sharing, and structured discussions through threads.

## Business Rules

### Chatroom Creation

1. **Company Membership Required**

   - Only company members can create chatrooms
   - Chatroom creator automatically becomes the chatroom admin
   - Company owner can create unlimited chatrooms

2. **Chatroom Types**

   - **Public**: All company members can join automatically
   - **Private**: Invitation required to join
   - **Direct**: One-on-one communication (future feature)

3. **Naming and Description**
   - Chatroom names must be unique within the company
   - Names: 3-100 characters, alphanumeric and spaces only
   - Descriptions: Optional, max 500 characters

### Member Management

1. **Role Hierarchy**

   - **Creator**: Full control, cannot be removed
   - **Admin**: Can manage members and settings
   - **Moderator**: Can manage messages and threads
   - **Member**: Standard participation

2. **Access Types**

   - **Full Access**: Can send messages, create threads, upload files
   - **Read Only**: Can view messages and download files only

3. **Member Limits**
   - Default maximum: 100 members per chatroom
   - Configurable per chatroom (1-1000 members)
   - Company owner can override limits

### Chatroom Settings

1. **File Upload Controls**

   - Enable/disable file uploads per chatroom
   - File size limits inherited from company settings
   - File type restrictions configurable

2. **Thread Management**

   - Enable/disable thread creation
   - Default thread permissions
   - Thread archiving policies

3. **Message Controls**
   - Message retention period (default: unlimited)
   - Message editing window (default: 24 hours)
   - Message deletion permissions

## State Management

### Chatroom Status

1. **Active**: Normal operation, all features available
2. **Archived**: Read-only access, no new messages or files
3. **Deleted**: Soft delete, hidden from UI, data preserved for 30 days

### Lifecycle Events

1. **Creation**

   - Chatroom created with default settings
   - Creator added as admin member
   - Initial system message posted

2. **Member Addition**

   - Invitation sent to user
   - User accepts and joins
   - Welcome message posted (optional)

3. **Member Removal**

   - Access revoked immediately
   - Member can rejoin if chatroom is public
   - Private chatrooms require new invitation

4. **Archival**
   - All threads and messages become read-only
   - File downloads remain available
   - Members notified of archival
