# Large File Processing Business Logic

## Overview

Large file processing handles files larger than 4GB using chunked upload technology. This system provides reliable uploads with progress tracking, resumable capabilities, and integration with the chat system.

## Business Rules

### File Size Limits

1. **Company-Level Limits**

   - Free Plan: 50GB total storage, 10GB per file
   - Pro Plan: 500GB total storage, 100GB per file
   - Enterprise Plan: Unlimited storage, 1TB per file

2. **Technical Limits**

   - Minimum chunk size: 1MB
   - Maximum chunk size: 50MB (default: 10MB)
   - Maximum concurrent uploads: 5 per user
   - Upload session timeout: 24 hours

3. **File Type Restrictions**
   - Allowed: Documents, images, videos, audio, archives
   - Blocked: Executables, scripts, system files
   - Quarantine: Suspicious files for manual review

### Upload Session Management

1. **Session Creation**

   - Initiated by authenticated user
   - Validated file metadata and permissions
   - Pre-allocated storage space check
   - Session ID generated for tracking

2. **Chunk Processing**

   - Sequential or parallel chunk uploads supported
   - Each chunk validated for integrity
   - Progress tracked in real-time
   - Failed chunks can be retried individually

3. **Session Completion**
   - All chunks validated and assembled
   - File integrity verified
   - Metadata stored in database
   - Download URL generated

## State Management

### Upload Status Flow

1. **Pending**: Session created, awaiting first chunk
2. **In Progress**: Chunks being uploaded
3. **Completed**: All chunks uploaded and assembled
4. **Failed**: Upload failed due to error
5. **Cancelled**: User cancelled upload
6. **Expired**: Session timed out

### Chunk Status

1. **Pending**: Chunk not yet uploaded
2. **Uploaded**: Chunk uploaded and validated
3. **Failed**: Chunk upload failed
4. **Retrying**: Chunk upload being retried

## Technical Architecture

### Chunked Upload Process

1. **Client-Side Chunking**

   - File split into configurable chunks
   - Each chunk gets unique identifier
   - Chunks uploaded in parallel or sequence
   - Client tracks overall progress

2. **Server-Side Assembly**

   - Chunks stored temporarily in MinIO/S3
   - Assembly process triggered on completion
   - File integrity verified using checksums
   - Original file reconstructed and stored

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Real-time progress via WebSocket
   - Chunk-level and overall progress
   - Upload speed and ETA calculations
   - Error reporting and retry suggestions

### Storage Strategy

1. **Temporary Storage**

   - Chunks stored in temporary bucket
   - Automatic cleanup after session completion/failure
   - Compressed storage for efficiency
   - Deduplication for identical chunks

2. **Permanent Storage**
   - Assembled files in production bucket
   - Versioned storage for file updates
   - Backup and replication policies
   - Lifecycle management for old files

## Business Logic

### Permission Validation

1. **Upload Authorization**

   - User must be member of target chatroom/thread
   - Storage quota must not be exceeded
   - File type must be allowed
   - User must have upload permissions

2. **Access Control**
   - Files inherit chatroom/thread permissions
   - Download requires membership verification
   - Signed URLs for secure access
   - Audit trail for all file operations

### Storage Quota Management

1. **Pre-Upload Check**

   - Calculate projected storage usage
   - Verify quota availability
   - Reserve space for upload
   - Return error if quota exceeded

2. **Dynamic Quota Updates**
   - Real-time quota tracking
   - Immediate update on completion
   - Graceful handling of quota changes
   - Notification when approaching limits

### Error Handling

1. **Upload Failures**

   - Automatic retry for transient failures
   - Manual retry for permanent failures
   - Partial upload recovery
   - User notification of issues

2. **Storage Issues**
   - Quota exceeded handling
   - Storage service unavailability
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Data corruption detection

## Performance Optimization

### Concurrent Uploads

1. **Parallel Processing**

   - Multiple chunks uploaded simultaneously
   - Configurable concurrency limits
   - Bandwidth throttling options
   - Server load balancing

2. **Resumable Uploads**
   - Session state persistence
   - Chunk validation on resume
   - Gap detection and filling
   - Optimistic progress tracking

### Caching Strategy

1. **Metadata Caching**

   - Upload session data cached
   - Chunk status cached in Redis
   - Progress updates cached
   - Expired cache cleanup

2. **File Access Caching**
   - Download URLs cached
   - File metadata cached
   - CDN integration for large files
   - Cache invalidation on updates

## Integration Points

### Chat System Integration

1. **Automatic Thread Creation**

   - File upload triggers thread creation
   - Thread context includes file metadata
   - Message notifications for upload completion
   - File sharing within thread context

2. **Real-time Notifications**
   - Upload progress broadcast to relevant users
   - Completion notifications via WebSocket
   - Error notifications to uploader
   - Storage quota warnings

### WebSocket Events

1. **Upload Progress Events**

   ```javascript
   // Event: file_upload_progress
   {
     sessionId: "uuid",
     chunkIndex: 5,
     progress: 45.2,
     uploadedBytes: 536870912,
     totalBytes: 1073741824
   }
   ```

2. **Upload Completion Events**
   ```javascript
   // Event: file_upload_completed
   {
     sessionId: "uuid",
     fileId: "uuid",
     fileName: "large-video.mp4",
     fileSize: 1073741824,
     downloadUrl: "https://...",
     chatroomId: "uuid",
     threadId: "uuid"
   }
   ```

## Security Considerations

### File Validation
